# Welcome to URA Design System

The URA Design System (UDS) aims to empower teams to create fast, accessible, and mobile-friendly digital services with a common set of UI components, patterns, and templates. It is generally based on, but not limited to, the [**Singapore Government Design System**](https://www.designsystem.tech.gov.sg/).

Where applicable, UDS complies with the [**Digital Service Standards (DSS)**](https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-service-standards/), which is a set of policies, standards, and guidelines to help agencies implement digital services that meet the goal of delivering digital services that are easy-to-use, seamless, and relevant, as set out in the [**Digital Government Blueprint**](https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-government-blueprint/).

## What is URA Design System (UDS)?

### UDS consists:

- Components are the collection of front-end components build together to create the user experience for our digital services.
- Templates to help jump-start development for sprint discussions
- Patterns that adhere to best practices and accessibility standards
- [**Figma UI Kit**](https://go.gov.sg/uds-uikit) to help anyone to quickly create prototypes for screen flows

## Who is UDS for?

It is for project teams and vendors (developers and designers) for designing the digital services portals. Intranet and extranet applications are recommended to use for the benefits of a design system.
