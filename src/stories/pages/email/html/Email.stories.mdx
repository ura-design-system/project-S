# Email Templates

## Email Design and Content Guidelines
- Do not include call-to-action (e.g. buttons with masked text) in the email content.
- Text links/hyperlinks are allowed if the exact url is spelled out (e.g. www.ura.gov.sg) and only can link to content pages (e.g. Homepage)
- For long urls (not ideal to fully spelt out), please use [go.gov.sg](https://go.gov.sg/) shortener.
